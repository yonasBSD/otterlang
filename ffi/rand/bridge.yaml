# Optional: Only specify dependency version/features if you need to pin them.
# All public functions are automatically extracted via rustdoc JSON.
dependency:
  name: "rand"
  version: "0.8"
# Functions are automatically extracted - no need to list them manually!
# When rustdoc extraction works (requires nightly Rust), all functions
# are automatically discovered and exposed.
# 
# For now, bridge.yaml is empty to demonstrate transparent extraction.
# When nightly is available, functions will be auto-extracted.
# Otherwise, you can add functions here as needed.
