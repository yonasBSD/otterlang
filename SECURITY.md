## Security Considerations

### Known Limitations

As an experimental language, OtterLang has some security considerations:

1. **FFI System**: FFI bridges load dynamic libraries. Only use trusted Rust crates.
2. **Memory Safety**: OtterLang uses reference counting and garbage collection. Memory safety bugs may exist.
3. **Runtime**: The JIT runtime executes generated code. Untrusted code execution should be avoided.
4. **No Sandboxing**: Currently, OtterLang programs run with full system permissions.

### Best Practices

To help maintain security when using OtterLang:

- **Validate Input**: Always validate user input and external data
- **Use Trusted FFI**: Only import Rust crates from trusted sources
- **Error Handling**: Use proper error handling (nil checks, etc.)
- **Keep Updated**: Use the latest version when available

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (0.1.x) and announced in:

- GitHub Releases
- Security Advisories
- CHANGELOG.md
